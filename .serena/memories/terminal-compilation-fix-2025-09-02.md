**Terminal Compilation Issue Fixed - 2025-09-02**

## Problem
- Material-UI Grid component TypeScript compilation errors
- `Grid item` props causing overload mismatch errors
- Webpack compilation failing during `./start-systems.sh merchant`

## Root Cause
- Using deprecated Grid component with `item` prop
- Incorrect import syntax for Grid2 component

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated Grid Import**: Changed from `Grid2 as Grid` to direct `Grid` import from `@mui/material/Grid2`
2. **Removed item Props**: Eliminated all `item` attributes from Grid components (Grid2 doesn't need them)
3. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**: Resolved all Material-UI Grid-related compilation issues

## Files Modified
- `localite-admin-dashboard/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`

## Result
- ✅ Admin dashboard compiles successfully
- ✅ Merchant portal compiles successfully  
- ✅ Both systems running on correct ports (3001/3002)
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Webpack builds successfully

## Testing
- Verified both systems accessible via HTTP
- Confirmed HTML responses from localhost:3001 and localhost:3002
